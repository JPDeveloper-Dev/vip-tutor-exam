# Coding Principles and Practices


1. Avoid duplication of code by creating reusable functions and components.
2. Write code that is simple and easy to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class should have only one responsibility.
   - **O**pen/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Objects should be replaceable by instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
   - **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
   - **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
4. Do not add functionality until it is necessary.
5. Write code that is easy to read and understand, using meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
6. Write tests to ensure your code works as expected and to catch bugs early.
7. Use version control systems like Git to manage changes to your codebase.
